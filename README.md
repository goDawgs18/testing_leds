# testing_leds

For this code I just wanted to make a basic LED lighting program. However I didn't want to use any of the Arduino code so it uses work arounds for the digitalWrite, pinMode, and delay functions

## Connection

Pins 3, 4, 5, and 6 are connected to LEDs and also with 2kOhm resistors

## Constants

interval: This is used as the delay in milliseconds between light up stages
